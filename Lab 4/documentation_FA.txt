FiniteAutomata - represents a M = (Q,Σ,δ,p,F) finite automata

The class reads the contents of the automata from a file upon creation using the read_from_file method.
The input file must contain in this order:
    - all the states
    - the alphabet
    - all transitions
    - all possible final states

The main method of this class is accepts(sequence) - sequence is the sequence to be checked by the automata
                                                   - returns false if the automata is not deterministic,
                                                   we reach a character which has no transition or
                                                   if the sequence is not accepted
                                                   (there is no way to reach the next character in the sequence)
                                                   - returns true otherwise

Structure of the FA.in input file:
    states = [state ","] state
    alphabet = [character ","] character
    transitions = [transition ","] transition
    transition = state "-" terminal "-" state
    final_states = [state ","] state
    FA = states "\n" alphabet "\n" transitions "\n" final_states
